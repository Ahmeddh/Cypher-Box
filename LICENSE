Modifications made by Cypher Box include, but are not limited to:

1. Custom backend features: 
- Integration of third party custodians and exchanges through API connections.
- Withdrawal/Top-up buttons connecting users' custodian account(s) to their onchain wallets (also known as 'Vaults') where users can withdraw and deposit funds to and from addresses that belong to their Vaults.
- Move to Cold or Hot Vault buttons: buttons that allow users to seamlessly transfer funds between their onchain Vaults 
2. Enhanced frontend functionality: 
- Withdrawal Thresholds: a threshold bar display to visulalise the user's balance and counterparty risk of storing funds on their custodian accounts
- Reserve Amount Threshold: a threshold value that specifies the remaining custodian account balance after an onchain withdrawal order.
- UTXO shapes also known as 'Capsules': graphical shapes displayed on Vault(s) card(s) and other screens that represent the value of bitcoin UTXOs.
- Intuitive onchain send flow that allow users to do coin control as a default option before specifying amount.
