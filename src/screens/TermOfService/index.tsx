                    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                        Cypher Box lets you connect through API(s) (create account and/or
                        login) to one or more Bitcoin custodians that (if benevolent) allow
                        you to request sending and receiving payments quickly and cheaply in
                        Bitcoin (BTC) through their Lightning Network infrastructure. A
                        custodian is an entity that allow you to transact and accumulate
                        bitcoin (up to a certain subjective threshold) quickly and cheaply
                        depending on your jurisdiction. The funds stored on your custodian
                        'Lightning Account(s)' are technically under the full control of the
                        custodian, NOT OURS, NOT YOURS. The balance shown on your Checking
                        Account(s) may or may not be real Bitcoin. Despite our efforts in
                        choosing the most trusted and regulated Bitcoin custodians, we can
                        never be certain that when you use the 'Receive', 'Send', 'Top-up', or
                        'Withdraw' functions the custodian(s) will credit/debit your Checking
                        Account(s) balance(s) if you receive/send bitcoin from/to another user
                        or from/to your vault with the fees they advertise, or if they will
                        uphold their promise in keeping their internal ledger matched one to
                        one with their bitcoin reserves. Moreover, while we carefully selected
                        our custodians for reliability, we cannot guarantee a 24/7 uptime or
                        that your particular transactions will be processed by them.
                        Custodians might face liquidity issues or other technical problems
                        that can only be solved on their side, NOT OURS. A Bitcoin custodian,
                        just like a regular bank or exchange, can seize, freeze, or steal the
                        balance displayed in your Lightning Account. Custodians can even
                        sometimes get hacked. Cypher Box LLC is not liable for any funds
                        stolen by the custodian(s) we integrate with. If you face any problems
                        in Lightning Account(s) you should first login to your Custodian’s
                        website or mobile application and validate your balance and
                        transaction history from their side. Cypher Box is not liable for any
                        error that occurs within the custodian(s)’s ledger(s) or in the
                        transfer of requests and callbacks through their API. Due to all the
                        uncertainties mentioned above; we highly recommend that you read and
                        follow the instructions and only store a measured amount of bitcoin
                        inside your Lightning Account, use multiple custodian Checking Accounts
                        to spread the counter-party risk, periodically monitor your Checking
                        Accounts’ balances and activities from the custodian(s) website or
                        application, and once you’re knowledgeable enough to understand
                        self-custody and the risks associated with holding your own keys,
                        withdraw your bitcoin into one of your Vaults preferably when your
                        balance reaches the threshold where it makes economic sense to pay for
                        Bitcoin Network fees and demand real ownership over your funds.

                    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                        Some custodians in Cypher Box may give you the option to buy or sell
                        'bitcoin' for fiat currency depending on your jurisdiction. These
                        regulated exchanges may also run their own lightning infrastructure so
                        they may also allow you to transact in bitcoin quickly and cheaply.
                        However, all the risks, uncertainties, and guidelines mentioned above
                        with regular bitcoin custodians also apply to cryptocurrency exchanges.

                    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                        Cypher Box enables you to create single, hierarchical deterministic
                        (HD), non-custodial wallet(s) (referred to as 'Vault(s)') for Bitcoin.
                        You can use these vaults to withdraw from your Lightning Account(s),
                        store, send, and receive the digital asset Bitcoin only (BTC). In order
                        to use the hot or cold storage Vault(s) you are expected to be fully
                        aware of the dangers associated with securing your 12-word backup
                        seedphrase. You are expected to know that; you should never lose access
                        to your seedphrase(s), you should write the words in their correct order
                        on a physical medium such as a paper or a metallic plate, you should
                        make multiple physical copies of them and store the copies in secure
                        locations, you should never share them with anyone including us, and you
                        should never ask us to recover your Vault(s) funds because the only
                        entity capable of doing so is the one that holds the private keys
                        represented in the form of a 12-word seedphrase which is YOU, NOT US.
                        These Vaults are intended for use by persons who are very knowledgeable
                        about cryptocurrency generally and HD non-custodial wallets in
                        particular. If you read our instructions and warnings carefully and
                        understand the risks associated with self-custody, you represent that
                        you qualify as such a person.

                        If you use our Services to create a Vault, the software will use an
                        algorithm to generate a random 12-word phrase as a seed to a BIP39
                        hierarchical wallet. This 12-word phrase is called a backup seedphrase
                        and if reproduced exactly stores all the information needed to recover
                        your Vault(s) if access through the App or phone Password, face-ID or
                        other authentication means is lost or otherwise not available.
